This is a Hospital Management System built in Java, which includes functionalities such as patient registration, doctor login, appointment scheduling, and more. 
The system is designed to streamline hospital operations, improve management efficiency, and ensure seamless patient care. 
It features an Admin Panel which allows the admin to manage users, view appointments, and update hospital data, a Doctor panel which enables doctors to log in and 
access their schedules, patient records, and medical history and lastly a patient panel where new patients can register, book appointments vew their own medical records.

As regards the technologies used, I used java for the backend logic and GUI, mysql for data storage and swing for the GUI.

All database queries are contained in a file named Queries, so ensure to run the queries before running the java classes. 
Ensure to install the required libraries (jdatepicker.jar and mysqlconnector.java) in the project structure.
Decide to run from patient login or doctor login or admin login.
